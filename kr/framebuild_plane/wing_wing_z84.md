## Wiring

The wiring below is valid for Pixhawk and Pixracer. Use the main
outputs, not the ones labeled with AUX. The motor controller needs to
have an in-built BEC, as the autopilot is not powering the servo rail.

Port | Connection
--- | ---
RC IN    | PPM or S.BUS / S.BUS2 input
MAIN 1   | Left Aileron
MAIN 2   | Right Aileron
MAIN 3   | Empty
MAIN 4   | Throttle


## Build Log

The images below give a rough idea about the assembly process, which is
